    What is the output of following code snippet?
    Public static void main (String [] args) {
    Double a = 10;
    Into b = 5 ;
    System.out.println (a%b);
    }


Output will be an error due to:
Public has it's 'P' in capital letter, which is wrong. Same for Double.
Into is not a keyword or data type. May be it should have been int.
if we correct the mistakes and find the output, it will be 0.0
