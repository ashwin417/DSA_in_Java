### Assignment – 1

Duration:30 minutes

"Write a java program which accepts multiple employees details ,

1)Create thread class

2)make the use of runnable interface in it."


### Assignment 2

Skill Description:

Gain hands-on expertise in Java Concurrency and Multithreading by immersing yourself in the
captivating narrative of the "Parallel Universe Explorer." Through a series of tasks, you'll master
essential concepts, tools, and techniques required for efficient parallel and reactive programming.

Problem Statement 2:
Extend the program to perform a sequential exploration of a timeline using Sequential Streams.
Implement a method that simulates sequential exploration tasks.

Code:

```
import java.util.List;
public class ParallelUniverseExplorer {
private static final ForkJoinPool pool = new ForkJoinPool();
private static final List<String> sequentialTimeline = List.of(/* sequential timeline data */);
public static void main(String[] args) {
// TODO: Initialize the Parallel Universe Explorer with RecursiveAction tasks
// TODO: Simulate sequential exploration
}
// TODO: Implement methods for sequential exploration
}
```
Learning Outcomes:

- Apply Sequential Streams for sequential exploration.
- Develop skills in simulating sequential exploration tasks.
This assignment provides a comprehensive journey into Java Concurrency and Multithreading,
allowing students to navigate the challenges of the "Parallel Universe Explorer" and gain practical
skills in initializing parallel tasks, exploring timelines sequentially and in parallel, implementing
reactive communication, and ensuring thread synchronization for shared resources
