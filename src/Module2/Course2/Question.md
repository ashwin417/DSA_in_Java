## Assignment 1 - BankApplication

Skill Description:

“Java Case Study - Serialization” assignment centres around mastering the concept of Java
Serialization, covering topics such as serialization basics, implementing the Serializable interface,
handling transient variables, and deserialization. Participants will gain hands-on experience in
designing, serializing, and deserializing objects, with a focus on creating resilient and efficient
serialization mechanisms.

Problem Statement 1:

You are working on a banking application that requires storing and retrieving customer information
securely. Design a Java program that serializes and deserializes customer objects, ensuring sensitive
information is properly handled. Implement a mechanism to encrypt and decrypt the serialized data
for enhanced security.

Learning Outcomes:
- Mastery of applying serialization in a secure customer data storage scenario.
- Proficiency in implementing encryption and decryption during serialization.
- Understanding the importance of secure data handling in real-world applications

Problem Statement 2:

As part of a game development team, you need to implement a system for saving and loading game
progress. Design a Java program that serializes and deserializes game state objects. Consider
scenarios where game levels, achievements, and player inventory need to be preserved.
Learning Outcomes:
- Proficiency in applying serialization for saving and loading game progress.
- Skill in handling complex object structures during serialization. 
- Understanding the practical considerations for preserving game state.

serialization mechanisms.

Problem Statement 3:

You are tasked with developing a distributed system where data needs to be transferred between
different components. Design a Java application that serializes and deserializes data across
networked devices. Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms to ensure data integrity
during transmission.

Learning Outcomes:

- Mastery of serialization in a distributed system scenario.
- Proficiency in handling network communication through serialization.
- Application of error handling mechanisms for data integrity in distributed systems.

- This assignment challenges participants to apply Java Serialization concepts in realistic scenarios,
enhancing their ability to address complex requirements in software development.
